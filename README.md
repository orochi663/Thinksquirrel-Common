# Thinksquirrel Common Libraries

### Overview

These libraries provide common functionality between Thinksquirrel Software products. They are not meant for general use, but the code is provided here for debugging/learning/adaptation purposes.

### Building the Libraries

The common libraries are in C# and for the most part require the Unity Game Engine.

#### Requirements

* A recent C# compiler - either .NET or Mono
* Unity 3.4+

#### Compiler Symbols

* COMPACT - less code, compatible with Unity Flash export for Unity 3.5+, Unity 3.4+ for all other platforms
* DEBUG - for debug builds (of course)

A set of perl scripts for OSX are provided (uses the default Unity installation for both the Mono compiler and UnityEngine/UnityEditor DLLs)

The C# files can also be directly integrated into a Unity project (this is not recommended).

### Using the Libraries

No documentation is provided for this code, and probably won't be - this README took a while to pop up!
